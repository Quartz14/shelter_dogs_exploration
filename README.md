### Things to consider when adopting shelter dogs
Its always exciting to become a pet owner, but its necessary we choose a dog that is suitable to our lifestyle and personality. What features are important to look out for when choosing a dog from a shelter?
By analysing the dataset on, shelter dogs that are ready for adoption we try to indentify and highlight some pointers that may help in the decision process of adopting a dog.

### Files: 
* Dataset-from Hungarian Database of Homeless Pets obtained from kaggle (link below)
* Jupyter notebook- containing the exploratory data analysis

### Key questions tackled:
* Is neutering essential to ensure your future pet is friendly?
* Does the gender of the dog affect how much it likes you?
* Can you grow your dog indoors?
* Do certain types of dogs take more time to adjust to the shelter and become ready for adoption, then others?

### Summary:
* Neutering doesn't affect the dog's friendliness towards humans.
* Most dogs like all humans.
* Ensure you have the space to support your dog, even after it grows.
* Speak to the caretaker, and spend some time with the dog before adopting.
